      <div id='e1-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>
            Create an interactive hypertext narrative that reveals something about yourself or an experience you've had.
            It could be a story about yourself, a journey through a topic you're interested in, a mode of navigation
            that mimics your personality, etc. There should be multiple HTML pages linked together by
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags. Each page could contain text and/or images. No styling. Limit your focus to
            story and interaction.

      <div id='e3-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>You will create a proposal for your upcoming <a class="hiExer"
               onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p1')">Project 1</a>.</p><br>
         <p>Your proposal should include a mockup. You can sketch it out on paper, in photoshop, using figma, or in any
            format, software, or process you like. (If you're feeling adventurous, you may even design and prototype
            directly in HTML/CSS)</p><br>
         <p>Include references to websites that you may have found during your web crawl from the previous exercise.
            Include a mood board of images, colors, and other relevant material to organize your creative thoughts. See
            the project description for some inspiration!

      <h3 id='e4' class="toggles">Exercise 4: Community Contact</h3>
      <div id='e4-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>Create a homepage for a community. It can be for a community that you're involved with, one that you admire,
            or a fictional community. For instance, a site for a colony of robots that lives on the moon, a nonprofit
            organization of your choice, or a site for an OSU student group that you're a member of or would like to
            start. You can imagine that this homepage is part of a larger website, but the links don't needed to lead
            anywhere.
            You can write <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;my link&lt;/a&gt;</code> to make a link that goes nowhere.</p><br>
         <p>You can try to recreate layout and interface patterns you've seen online, or be more experimental with your
            design. In any case, your design should be clearly informed by the content it is representing. Just like
            with print design, how can you use web design to communicate an idea, identity, and community?</p><br>
         <p>Your design does not need to be responsive, but should work on either a standard laptop monitor or a mobile
            phone (your choice). When you post your project link, also post a screenshot as it looks on your device for
            reference. See tutorial on device preview to preview your site for mobile.

      <h3 id='e6' class="toggles">Exercise 6: Transformation</h3>
      <div id='e6-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>Create an webpage that transforms between two distinct perspectives or identities through the user's
            interaction with it. "Identity" could mean aspects of a personality, political perspectives, moods, cultural
            backgrounds, or anything else. "User interaction" could encompass click, hover, mouseout (leaving element),
            doubleclick, keypress, window resize, scroll, or anything else. Basically, your page should start in one
            mode,
            and look very different during or after user interaction. It is suggested that you make use of <a
               href="https://api.jquery.com/category/events/" target="_blank">JQuery events</a> and <a
               href="https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/" target="_blank">JQuery events</a>, though not all of
            these
            will be applicable.</p>

      <h3 id='e7' class="toggles">Exercise 7: Explore + Final Project Proposal</h3>
      <div id='e7-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>This project is about beginning to think about your <a class="hiExer"
            onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p2')">final project</a> and teaching yourself something new.
            First, think about some possible ideas for your final project. What new skills might you want to learn to
            complete this? For example, are you interested in working with scrolling, hovering, 3D graphics, sound, or
            something else?</p><br>
         <p>Your goal is to learn and explore a new library, web or coding tool, and use it to make a sketch or
            prototype of something you may want to incorporate into your final project. Begin by scanning through the
            documentation. Does it feel within your reach? Follow / fill out the worksheet (TBA).</p>
