         <p>
            Create an interactive hypertext narrative that reveals something about yourself or an experience you've had.
            It could be a story about yourself, a journey through a topic you're interested in, a mode of navigation
            that mimics your personality, etc. There should be multiple HTML pages linked together by
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags. Each page could contain text and/or images. No styling. Limit your focus to
            story and interaction.

         <p>
            We will create a database of websites as a class and we will continue contributing to this database
            throughout the rest of the semester. Join our <a

               target="_blank">are.na group</a> (sign-up for an account if you haven't already). Crawl the web for
            innovative, creative, or unconventional websites in their interaction, structure, design, purpose,
            philosophy, or context. Find 10 websites to begin this exercise. Add each link as a new block in our <a

               target="_blank">Web Crawl Archive</a> channel on are.na. In the block's description, give a two+ sentence
            statement as to why you chose the website and why you think it is innovative, creative, or unconventional.
            Each week, you should add to the channel by contributing 2+ links & a correlating description. This process
            and collection will serve as a resource and to broaden our scope and diversify the ways we envision the web
            as both a medium and platform. Below are some existing are.na channels to begin your search. Interact with a
            handful of websites before selecting and post only ones that are not already in our archive.

      <div id='e4-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>Create a proposal for your homepage.</p><br>
         <p>Your proposal should include a mockup. You can sketch it out on paper, in photoshop, using figma, or in any
            format, software, or process you like.</p><br>
         <p>Include references to websites that you may have found during your web crawl from the previous exercise.
            Include a mood board of images, colors, and other relevant material to organize your creative thoughts.

      <h3 id='e5' class="toggles">Exercise 5: Community Contact</h3>
      <div id='e5-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>Create a homepage for a community. It can be for a community that you're involved with, one that you admire,
            or a fictional community. For instance, a site for a colony of robots that lives on the moon, a nonprofit
            organization of your choice, or a site for a UCLA student group that you're a member of or would like to
            start. You can imagine that this homepage is part of a larger website, but the links don't needed to lead
            anywhere.
            You can write <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;my link&lt;/a&gt;</code> to make a link that goes nowhere.</p><br>
         <p>You can try to recreate layout and interface patterns you've seen online, or be more experimental with your
            design. In any case, your design should be clearly informed by the content it is representing. Just like
            with print design, how can you use web design to communicate an idea, identity, and community?</p><br>
         <p>Your design does not need to be responsive, but should work on either a standard laptop monitor or a mobile
            phone (your choice). When you post your project link, also post a screenshot as it looks on your device for
            reference. See tutorial on device preview to preview your site for mobile.

      <h3 id='e6' class="toggles">Exercise 6: Transformation</h3>
      <div id='e6-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>Create an webpage that transforms between two distinct perspectives or identities through the user's
            interaction with it. "Identity" could mean aspects of a personality, political perspectives, moods, cultural
            backgrounds, or anything else. "User interaction" could encompass click, hover, mouseout (leaving element),
            doubleclick, keypress, window resize, scroll, or anything else. Basically, your page should start in one
            mode,
            and look very different during or after user interaction. It is suggested that you make use of <a
               href="https://api.jquery.com/category/events/" target="_blank">JQuery events</a> and <a
               href="https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/" target="_blank">JQuery events</a>, though not all of
            these
            will be applicable.</p>

      <h3 id='e7' class="toggles">Exercise 7: Explore + Final Project Proposal</h3>
      <div id='e7-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
         <p>This project is about beginning to think about your final project and teaching yourself something new.
            First, think about some possible ideas for your final project. What new skills might you want to learn to
            complete this? For example, are you interested in working with scrolling, hovering, 3D graphics, sound, or
            something else?</p><br>
         <p>Your goal is to learn and explore a new library, web or coding tool, and use it to make a sketch or
            prototype of something you may want to incorporate into your final project. Begin by scanning through the
            documentation. Does it feel within your reach? Follow / fill out the worksheet (TBA).</p><br>
         Submit your PDF document to <span class="hiExer">EXERCISES ⇒ #exercise-7</span>
         <br>
         <p>Use exercises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as a prototype for your final project. Continue the work and ideas that you created for one of these projects. Expand the idea beyond the original one-week project into a project that can be completed for the final review.
