      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
         This studio course introduces students to the World Wide Web. We will explore creative, technical,
         and critical tools to realize web-based projects. This course is focused on gaining a deeper
         understanding of the Internet as a medium & platform for creative expression—where did it come from, how does
         it work, how do you make things for it, and what do you want to say?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
         Technical workshops on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design support the development of a series of studio
         projects utilizing a variety of network tools. These projects are framed by seminar-style discussions examining
         the cultural, social, political, and philosophical implications of the Internet. We’ll consider the roles of
         race, gender, sexuality, disability, class, and influence within an increasingly networked world, and
         strategies of response as artists, designers, & technologists.
      </p>

      <h3>Format & Delivery</h3>
      <p>
         Within the current paradigm of physical distancing, this course will be taught <span class="highlight">entirely
            online—across the world wide web</span>. This is a process-oriented
         studio. It is comprised of assignments (mini-tasks, exercises, &
         projects), participatory activities (workshops/exercises & presentations), individual and group
         discussions, and reviews. Synchronous Zoom and Mozilla Hubs meetings are used to introduce
         assignments, view screenings, have group critique and discussions, and most importantly do
         workshops together. The workshops done in class work towards exercises assigned in the course.
         Students are expected to complete Mini-tasks (which include readings and responses) and Projects
         asychronously unless it is an open-studio day or unless otherwise noted in the schedule.
      </p>
      <h3>Credit Hours & Work Expectations</h3>
      <p>This is a 3-credit-hour, 16-week studio course. According to Ohio State policy, students
         should expect
         around 6 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (workshops and
         discussions) in addition to 3 hours of out of class work such as readings, exercises, & projects to receive a grade of (C) average. In total,
         students
         should be prepared to commit a minimum of 9 hours per week to this course.
      </p>

      <h3><a onclick="openSection('#discussions', 'd1')">Discussions</h3></a>
      <p>We will have eight discussions during the quarter. Each week, you are required to read/watch/listen to at least one of the posted media in advance. In addition, each person will be responsible for leading one 30 minute discussion, along with 1-2 other people. You can sign up for your preferred discussion week by posted to <span class="highlight">DISCUSSIONS ⇒ #init</span> with your top three choices. We will assign based on order received. Your group and discussion assignments can be viewed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FwJymWx1EwK8SuupSc7MZdXpnAkdLp0S9Ta9uFb2uMw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> discussion spreadsheet</a>. We will take the liberty of assigning you to a discussion group if you fail to sign up in time. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
         For the discussion you lead:
         <ul>
            <li>Consume all posted media</li>
            <li>Prepare a few slides to focus the discussion. Include key points from the media, and a couple relevant external references or examples. These examples might be artworks, news articles, websites quotes, videos, etc.</li>
            <li>Prepare a set of questions to guide the discussion</li>
            <li>Meet with us during office hours in advance of your discussion to review your questions and plan. Reach out to us on Discord in advance to schedule a time to meet.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Weeklies</h3>
      <p>As the name suggests, weeklies are due every week throughout the semester (between mon-sun at your convenience). Weeklies include ongoing <span class="highlight">blog entries</span> and contributions to the class <span class="highlight">web crawl archive</span> via are.na (more details below). Weeklies help keep you actively engaged with the web as a platform and tool for creative expression and exploration. They are meant to be light-hearted while establishing a working methodology around internet practices.</p><br>
      <h4><span class="highlight">>></span>Blog Entry</h4>
      <p>You will maintain a blog throughout the semester. With the exception of the first week, you will write a blog entry every week that responds to our workshops, exercises, readings, discussions, and/or presentations in our course. Though you do not need to touch on everything that may have occurred during class, you should involve your personal thoughts and reflections for that week. This can also include other things happening in your life that you would like to share on the web. They should be at least 3 paragraphs (~400+ words) but feel free to use your web space creatively. Space out your paragraphs, use line breaks, text transformations, and indents expressively. As we learn how to incorporate styling, interaction, and animations, it will broaden your skills to express yourself through the web. You should incorporate a variety of images, audio, and other media forms if they help you formulate your thoughts on the web. Each entry should be written as an .html page with a title and date.Have a look at Laurel Schulst's <a href="https://laurel.world/notebooks/ellipsis/index.html"
         target="_blank">ellipsis blog</a> for some inspiration. Submit your link to <span class="highlight">WEEKLIES ⇒ </span>
            accordingly
      <br>
      <h4><span class="highlight">>></span>Web Crawl Archive</h4>
      <p>
         We will create a database of websites as a class and we will continue contributing to this database
         throughout the rest of the semester. Join our <a
            href="https://www.are.na/group/internet-art-art-3001-spring-2021/invite/UngsjRLoeM7UnefJ1ax97Q"
            target="_blank">are.na group</a> (sign-up for an account if you haven't already). Crawl the web for
         innovative, creative, or unconventional websites in their interaction, structure, design, purpose,
         philosophy, or context. Find 10 websites to begin this exercise (week 2). Add each link as a new block in our <a
            href="https://www.are.na/group/internet-art-art-3001-spring-2021/invite/UngsjRLoeM7UnefJ1ax97Q"
            target="_blank">Web Crawl Archive</a> channel on are.na. In the block's description, give a two+ sentence
         statement as to why you chose the website and why you think it is innovative, creative, or unconventional.
         Each week, you should add to the channel by contributing 2+ links & a correlating description. This process
         and collection will serve as a resource and to broaden our scope and diversify the ways we envision the web
         as both a medium and platform. Below are some existing are.na channels to begin your search. Interact with a
         handful of websites before selecting and post only ones that are not already in our archive.

      <h3>Workshops & <a onclick="openSection('#exercises', 'e0')">Exercises</a></h3>
      <p>Workshops and Exercises in class go hand-in-hand. As long as you are present and participating in
         the class workshops, you should be able to complete each exercise without much time spent outside
         of class. That means you need to gain access to a second screen to follow along fluidly. Exercises
         are either completed in one class session or over the course of several workshop class sessions.
         See the schedule for more information on when workshops are and when exercises are due.</p>

      <h3><a onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p1')">Projects</a></h3>
      <p>You will complete two projects in this course. Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to
         one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than
         one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in
         projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save
         issues, software errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your
         desktop, online, and/or on an external hard drive or USB stick in case your computer is
         lost.
      </p>
      <h3>Grading</h3>
      <span class="hiGrade">
         <p>Percentage breakdown is as follows:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>10% — Participation & Interaction</li>
            <li>10% — Weeklies</li>
            <li>20% — <a onclick="openSection('#exercises', 'p1')">Exercises</a></li>

            </li>
            <li>30% — <a onclick="openSection('#projects', 'p2')">Project 2</a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Your work will be assessed according to your overall enthusiasm: The amount of time, effort,
            and thought you contribute to the course; your willingness to explore, take risks, and
            expand into a new range of experiences; attention to quality of ideas and quality in
            execution of your ideas; critical thought; skills in craft according to assignment
            objectives; an understanding of materials presented in class and an ability to relate course
            materials to discussions, assignments, and your own art practice.

      <h3>Data Responsibility</h3>
      <p>Back up your work. Inevitably, computers crash. Sometimes they get stolen. There are measures
         that you can take to prevent significant loss of data. These include Cloud back-ups,
         external devices or disc storage.
      </p>
      <h3>Attendance</h3>
      <p>
         The successful completion of this course relies on workshop submissions, project updates and
         submissions, attending zoom and hubs sessions, and student participation in discussions. Timely and
         consistent contributions are critical to deliver the content of this course.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Timely and productive class activities and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in evaluation
         of assignments. Please arrive on time for each class session. If you are more than 10 minutes late,
         you will
         be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. All absences from class will be
         counted, however, and in the
         instance that you miss three class meetings, I will request to meet with you to discuss concerns
         pertaining to attendance. The Department of Art recognizes that students may on occasion miss class
         due to extenuating circumstances such as illness, emergency or other important matters. When this
         occurs, it is your responsibility to request updates and notes and to review course materials on
         Carmen. Please communicate attendance concerns with me in a timely manner when appropriate.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the
         assessment of your progress. You are expected to be present and active for the entire class
         period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share
         your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback
         during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and
         supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of
         different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we
         are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility,
         apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.
      </p>
      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p><a href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> <span
            class="print">(http://discordapp.com/)</span> is used as our primary mode of
         communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/jqs9GK4p"
            target="_blank">server</a>, and keep up to date with
         announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings,
         screenings, and learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
      </p>
      <h3>Discord Server Interaction</h3>
      <p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord server is required. We will use
         Discord to gather and share resources, respond to readings and peers' works, and to share
         your work in progress.
      </p>
      <h3>Commitment to Equity & Diversity</h3>
      <p>The classroom is a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and
         cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge
         and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use
         preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
         Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our
         conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that
         certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are
         undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or
         vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and
         instructors is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should
         feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that
         something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
         instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one
         another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece
         of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor. (<a

      <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
      <p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body.
         Our programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to
         provide opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them.
         We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth
         and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among
         each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach \sout{his or
         her} their own potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status,
         which is defined as age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin,
         race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is prohibited.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Departmental Notes & College Policies</h2>
      <h3>PPE & Related College Covid Policies</h3>
      <p>Safe campus requirements include but are not limited to wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical
         distancing, health symptom monitoring, participating in contact tracing, quarantine and
         isolation, and additional safety expectations detailed at <a href="safeandhealthy.osu.edu"
            target="_blank">safeandhealthy.osu.edu</a>. All Ohio State students, faculty and staff
         are expected to meet the behavioral and safety expectations under the Safe Campus
         Requirements when they physically participate in any university activity, on or off campus.
         All students, faculty and staff also will be required to perform a daily health check to
         report body temperature each day they intend to be physically on an Ohio State campus.
         Failure to adhere to these requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement
         mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation, whereby adherence will be reinforced
         through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary action whenever
         possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
         follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the
            student and/or student organization's behavior endangers the health or safety of campus
            community members, on or off campus, and/or fails to comply with the directives outlined
            in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which a student is not
            adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this
            does not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy
            requirements. If the student continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave
            the location and not to return until they are prepared to follow the requirements.
         </li>
         <li>For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident
            should be reported to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential
            disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate tracking. Even if the student's name
            is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the university in
            evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be acknowledged that Student Conduct
            will be unable to take disciplinary action without identifying information.
         </li>

      <h3>COVID-19 Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h3>
      <p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required
         quarantine due to exposure will transition course activities to distance learning to the
         extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students will work with
         instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities
         related to course objectives and assignments will be provided.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online
         interactions and learning at a distance will occur. All university standards and policies
         remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for students with
         disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be
         meeting and interacting in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves
         and treat others as if we are meeting in person.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online
         delivery mode for the remainder of the semester.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis,
         symptoms, or required quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course
         continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may transition to an online delivery mode
         temporarily.
      </p>
      <h3>Accommodations</h3>
      <p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to
         make <i>reasonable accommodations</i> for students who are unable to be safely present in
         the classroom <i>and</i> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of Student
         Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean
         streaming lectures on Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that
         involve laboratory work, studio work, or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable
         accommodation will not always be possible. Students are expected to work with their advisors
         and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling needs.
      </p>
      <h3>Grade Forgiveness</h3>
      <p>The Grade Forgiveness Rule allows undergraduate students to petition to repeat up to three courses.
         The grade in the repeated course will permanently replace the original grade for the course in the
         calculation of the student's cumulative GPA.Only a first repeat can be used this way; all other
         repeats of the same course will be included under the general course repeatability rule.</p><br>
      <p>The original grade will remain on the student's transcript and some graduate/professional school
         admission processes will re-calculate the student's GPA to include the original grade. See OSU's <a
            href="https://advising.osu.edu/grade-forgiveness-0" target="_blank">Grade Forgiveness</a> page
         for more information.</p>
      <h3>Sexual Misconduct / Relationship Violence</h3>
      <p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
         offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied
         to offenses against other protected categories (e.g., race). If you or someone you know has
         been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate resources at <a
            href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank">http://titleix.osu.edu/</a>
         \href{http://titleix.osu.edu/}{http://titleix.osu.edu} or by contacting the Ohio State Title
         IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at <a href="mailto:titleix@osu.edu" target="_blank">titleix@osu.edu</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Trigger Warning</h3>
      <p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to
         descriptions of and/or scenes depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence
         and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while watching/reading this
         material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend,
         contacting a Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a href="tel:614292111" target="_blank">614-292-1111</a>,
         or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank">614-292-5766</a>, and
         contacting the instructor if
         needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming
         this media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to
         each other may result in dismissal from the class.
      </p>
      <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
      <p>It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish
         procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term
         “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed;
         illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with
         examinations and artwork created in studio courses. Instructors shall report all instances of
         alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information,
         see the <a href="https://studentconduct.osu.edu/for-students/understanding-the-student-conduct-process"
            target="_blank">Code of Student Conduct</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         The Department of Art adheres to all aspects of this Code of Conduct especially in matters relating
         to the following: Academic Misconduct, Endangering Health or Safety, Sexual Misconduct, Destruction
         of Property, and Theft/Unauthorized Use of Property.</p>

      <h3>Reusing Past Work</h3>
      <p>In general, you are prohibited in university courses from turning in work from a past class to your
         current class, even if you modify it. If you want to build on past research or revisit a topic
         explored in previous courses, please discuss the situation with your instructor at the start of the
         assignment/project.</p>
      <h3>Disability Services</h3>
      <p>The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you
         anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental
         health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let us know immediately so that we
         can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, we may request that
         you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements
         with us as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented
         in a timely fashion. Fore more information contact the SLDS office.

      <h3>Mental Health Services</h3>
      <p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as
         strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty
         concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead
         to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily
         activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other
         concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the

      <h3>General Class and Studio Policies</h3>
      <p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
         and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual
         orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
         to the instructor and may include the student's legal name unless changed via the University
         Name Change policy. We will gladly honor your request to address you by another name or
         gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so that we may make
         appropriate changes to our records.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language,
         imagery, or dialogue that may be challenging or offend some students. While no student is
         required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or design that offends them,
         it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful
         manner. Art can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively
         discussion, concepts and imagery. Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.)
         can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and provocative, so please, engage
         in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Please contact us in advance (during the first week of class or as soon as circumstances
         develop during the term) if you have circumstances that may affect your performance and
         ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this course.
