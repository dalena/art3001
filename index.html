                        <p>
                            This studio course introduces students to the World Wide Web. We will explore creative,
                            technical, and critical tools to realize web-based projects. This course is focused on
                            gaining a deeper understanding of the Internet as a medium & platform for creative
                            expression—where did it come from, how does it work, how do you make things for it, and what
                            do you want to say?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Technical workshops on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design support the development of a
                            series of studio projects utilizing a variety of network tools. These projects are framed by
                            seminar-style discussions examining the cultural, social, political,
                            and philosophical implications of the Internet. We’ll consider the roles of race, gender,
                            sexuality, disability, class, and influence within an increasingly networked world, and
                            strategies of response as artists, designers,
                            & technologists.
                        </p>
                        <!-- 
      <h3>Learning Goals</h3>

                        <h3>Format & Delivery</h3>
                        <p>
                            Within the current paradigm of physical distancing, this course will be taught <span
                                class="highlight">entirely
                                online—across the world wide web</span>. This is a process-oriented studio. It is
                            comprised of assignments (exercises, & projects), participatory activities
                            (workshops/exercises & presentations), individual and group discussions,
                            and reviews. Synchronous Zoom and Mozilla Hubs meetings are used to introduce assignments,
                            view screenings, have group critique and discussions, and most importantly do workshops
                            together. The workshops done in class work towards
                            exercises assigned in the course. Students are expected to complete weekly tasks, readings
                            and responses, and Projects asychronously unless it is an open-studio day or unless
                            otherwise noted in the schedule.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Credit Hours & Work Expectations</h3>
                        <p>This is a 3-credit-hour, 16-week studio course. According to Ohio State policy, students
                            should expect around 6 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (workshops and
                            discussions) in addition to 3 hours of out of class
                            work such as readings, exercises, & projects to receive a grade of (C) average. In total,
                            students should be prepared to commit a minimum of 9 hours per week to this course.
                        </p>

                        <h3><a onclick="openSection('#discussions', 'd1')">Discussions</h3></a>
                        <p>We will have eight discussions during the quarter. Each week, you are required to
                            read/watch/listen to at least one of the posted media in advance. In addition, each person
                            will be responsible for leading one 30 minute discussion,
                            along with 1-2 other people. You can sign up for your preferred discussion week by posted to
                            <span class="highlight">DISCUSSIONS ⇒ #init</span> with your top three choices. We will

                                    questions and plan. Reach out to us on Discord in advance to schedule a time to
                                    meet.</li>

                        <h3>Weeklies</h3>
                        <p>As the name suggests, weeklies are due every week throughout the semester (between mon-sun at
                            your convenience). Weeklies include ongoing <span class="highlight">blog entries</span> and
                            contributions to the class <span class="highlight">web crawl archive</span> via are.na (more
                            details below). Weeklies help keep you actively engaged with the web as a platform and tool
                            for creative expression and exploration. They are meant to be light-hearted while
                            establishing a working methodology
                            around internet practices.</p><br>
                        <h4><span class="highlight">>></span>Blog Entry</h4>
                        <p>You will maintain a blog throughout the semester. With the exception of the first week, you
                            will write a blog entry every week that responds to our workshops, exercises, readings,
                            discussions, and/or presentations in our course.
                            Though you do not need to touch on everything that may have occurred during class, you
                            should involve your personal thoughts and reflections for that week. This can also include
                            other things happening in your life that
                            you would like to share on the web. They should be at least 3 paragraphs (~400+ words) but
                            feel free to use your web space creatively. Space out your paragraphs, use line breaks, text
                            transformations, and indents expressively.
                            As we learn how to incorporate styling, interaction, and animations, it will broaden your
                            skills to express yourself through the web. You should incorporate a variety of images,
                            audio, and other media forms if they help
                            you formulate your thoughts on the web. Each entry should be written as an .html page with a
                            title and date. Have a look at Laurel Schulst's <a
                                href="https://laurel.world/notebooks/ellipsis/index.html" target="_blank">ellipsis
                                blog</a> for some inspiration. Submit your link to <span class="highlight">WEEKLIES
                                ⇒</span> accordingly
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4><span class="highlight">>></span>Web Crawl Archive</h4>
                        <p>
                            We will create a database of websites as a class and we will continue contributing to this
                            database throughout the rest of the semester. Join our <a
                                href="https://www.are.na/group/internet-art-art-3001-spring-2021/invite/UngsjRLoeM7UnefJ1ax97Q"
                                target="_blank">are.na group</a> (sign-up for an account if you haven't already). Crawl
                            the web for innovative, creative, or unconventional websites in their interaction,
                            structure, design, purpose, philosophy, or context.
                            Find 10 websites to begin this exercise (week 2). Add each link as a new block in our <a
                                href="https://www.are.na/group/internet-art-art-3001-spring-2021/invite/UngsjRLoeM7UnefJ1ax97Q"
                                target="_blank">Web Crawl Archive</a> channel on are.na. In the block's description,
                            give a two+ sentence statement as to why you chose the website and why you think it is
                            innovative, creative, or unconventional. Each week, you should add to the channel by
                            contributing 2+ links & a correlating description. This process and collection will serve as
                            a resource and to broaden our scope and diversify the ways we envision the web as both a
                            medium and platform. Below are some existing
                            are.na channels to begin your search. Interact with a handful of websites before selecting
                            and post only ones that are not already in our archive.

                        <h3>Workshops & <a onclick="openSection('#exercises', 'e0')">Exercises</a></h3>
                        <p>Workshops and Exercises in class go hand-in-hand. As long as you are present and
                            participating in the class workshops, you should be able to complete each exercise without
                            much time spent outside of class. That means you need
                            to gain access to a second screen to follow along fluidly. Exercises are either completed in
                            one class session or over the course of several workshop class sessions. See the schedule
                            for more information on when workshops
                            are and when exercises are due.</p>

                        <p>You will complete two projects in this course. Projects are due at the start of class on the
                            date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to one week late for a one letter grade
                            deduction off the project grade. Work that is
                            more than one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to
                            turn in projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to
                            save issues, software errors, computer
                            crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your desktop, online, and/or on an
                            external hard drive or USB stick in case your computer is lost.

                        <p>Back up your work. Inevitably, computers crash. Sometimes they get stolen. There are measures
                            that you can take to prevent significant loss of data. These include Cloud back-ups,
                            external devices or disc storage.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Attendance</h3>
                        <p>
                            The successful completion of this course relies on workshop submissions, project updates and
                            submissions, attending zoom and hubs sessions, and student participation in discussions.
                            Timely and consistent contributions are critical to deliver the content
                            of this course.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Timely and productive class activities and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in
                            evaluation of assignments. Please arrive on time for each class session. If you are more
                            than 10 minutes late, you will be marked tardy.
                            Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. All absences from class will be counted,
                            however, and in the instance that you miss three class meetings, I will request to meet with
                            you to discuss concerns pertaining to
                            attendance. The Department of Art recognizes that students may on occasion miss class due to
                            extenuating circumstances such as illness, emergency or other important matters. When this
                            occurs, it is your responsibility to
                            request updates and notes and to review course materials on Carmen. Please communicate
                            attendance concerns with me in a timely manner when appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Participation</h3>
                        <p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the
                            assessment of your progress. You are expected to be present and active for the entire class
                            period. Participation is critical to passing
                            and enjoying this class. Do the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class
                            meetings and discussions, offer feedback during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe
                            space in which you feel encouraged
                            and supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate
                            of different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we
                            are building together. Don’t assume,
                            ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility, apologize, and learn. Help each other
                            in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.
                        </p>

                                class="print">(http://discordapp.com/)</span> is used as our primary mode of
                            communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a
                                href="https://discord.gg/EXpWwaru8k" target="_blank">server</a>, and keep up to date
                            with announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources,
                            readings, screenings, and learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Discord Server Interaction</h3>
                        <p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord server is required. We will use
                            Discord to gather and share resources, respond to readings and peers' works, and to share
                            your work in progress.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Commitment to Equity & Diversity</h3>
                        <p>The classroom is a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and
                            cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge
                            and embrace the different identities and
                            backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect
                            self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and
                            supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization
                            and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender,
                            race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and
                            marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people
                            feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort
                            between the students and instructors is needed to create a supportive learning environment.
                            While everyone should feel free to experiment
                            creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or
                            shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion
                            as a valuable opportunity for us to grow
                            and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or
                            included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor. (<a

                            when they physically participate in any university activity, on or off campus. All students,

                                not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy
                                requirements. If the student continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave
                                the location and not to return until they are prepared
                                to follow the requirements.
                            </li>
                            <li>For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident
                                should be reported to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential
                                disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate
                                tracking. Even if the student's name is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be
                                made to assist the university in evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be
                                acknowledged that Student Conduct will be unable
                                to take disciplinary action without identifying information.

                        <h3>COVID-19 Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required
                            quarantine due to exposure will transition course activities to distance learning to the
                            extent that they are able during periods of mandated
                            absence. Students will work with instructors to confirm their ability to participate or
                            alternative learning activities related to course objectives and assignments will be
                            provided.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online
                            interactions and learning at a distance will occur. All university standards and policies
                            remain in place as related to Title IX, academic
                            misconduct, allowances for students with disabilities, studio conduct and respect for
                            others, and other related issues. We will be meeting and interacting in an online format,
                            not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves
                            and treat others as if we are meeting in person.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online
                            delivery mode for the remainder of the semester.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis,
                            symptoms, or required quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course
                            continuity. If the instructor is able,
                            the course may transition to an online delivery mode temporarily.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Accommodations</h3>
                        <p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to
                            make <i>reasonable accommodations</i> for students who are unable to be safely present in
                            the classroom <i>and</i> have been approved
                            for an accommodation by the office of Student Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture
                            course, such an accommodation might mean streaming lectures on Zoom or making recordings
                            available to the students. For classes
                            that involve laboratory work, studio work, or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable
                            accommodation will not always be possible. Students are expected to work with their advisors
                            and, where appropriate, SLDS to find
                            workable solutions to their scheduling needs.

                        <h3>Grade Forgiveness</h3>
                        <p>The Grade Forgiveness Rule allows undergraduate students to petition to repeat up to three
                            courses. The grade in the repeated course will permanently replace the original grade for
                            the course in the calculation of the student's
                            cumulative GPA.Only a first repeat can be used this way; all other repeats of the same
                            course will be included under the general course repeatability rule.</p><br>
                        <p>The original grade will remain on the student's transcript and some graduate/professional
                            school admission processes will re-calculate the student's GPA to include the original
                            grade. See OSU's <a href="https://advising.osu.edu/grade-forgiveness-0"

                        <p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to
                            descriptions of and/or scenes depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence
                            and its aftermath. If needed, please take
                            care of yourself while watching/reading this material (leaving classroom to take a

                        <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
                        <p>It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish
                            procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The
                            term “academic misconduct” includes all
                            forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed; illustrated by, but not limited to,
                            cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with examinations and artwork
                            created in studio courses. Instructors
                            shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule

                        <p>In general, you are prohibited in university courses from turning in work from a past class
                            to your current class, even if you modify it. If you want to build on past research or
                            revisit a topic explored in previous courses,
                            please discuss the situation with your instructor at the start of the assignment/project.

                            These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance

                        <p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
                            and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual
                            orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities.
                            Class rosters are provided to the instructor and may include the student's legal name unless
                            changed via the University Name Change policy. We will gladly honor your request to address
                            you by another name or gender pronoun.
                            Please advise us of this early in the semester so that we may make appropriate changes to
                            our records.

                        <p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language,
                            imagery, or dialogue that may be challenging or offend some students. While no student is
                            required to participate in a presentation
                            or discussion of art or design that offends them, it is important to remain open-minded and
                            participate in a cooperative and respectful manner. Art can often challenge our ideas and
                            experiences, and can lead us into some
                            lively discussion, concepts and imagery. Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences,
                            etc.) can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and provocative, so please,
                            engage in the exchange of ideas respectfully.

                            <p>Create a homepage for a community. It can be for a community that you're involved with,
                                one that you admire, or a fictional community. For instance, a site for a colony of
                                robots that lives on the moon, a nonprofit organization
                                of your choice, or a site for an OSU student group that you're a member of or would like
                                to start. You can imagine that this homepage is part of a larger website, but the links
                                don't needed to lead anywhere. You can write
                                <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;my link&lt;/a&gt;</code> to make a link that goes nowhere.

                            <p>You can try to recreate layout and interface patterns you've seen online, or be more
                                experimental with your design. In any case, your design should be clearly informed by
                                the content it is representing. Just like with print
                                design, how can you use web design to communicate an idea, identity, and community?

                            <p>Your design does not need to be responsive, but should work on either a standard laptop
                                monitor or a mobile phone (your choice). When you post your project link, also post a
                                screenshot as it looks on your device for reference.

                                something new. First, think about some possible ideas for your final project.
                                What new skills might you want to learn to complete this? For example, are you
                                interested in working with scrolling, hovering, 3D graphics, sound, or something else?

                            <p>Your goal is to learn and explore a new library, web or coding tool, and use it to make a
                                sketch or prototype of something you may want to incorporate into your final project.
                                Begin by scanning through the documentation. Does
                                it feel within your reach? Follow / fill out the worksheet (TBA).</p>
